### fixall command
Run `fixall` command followed the the specified directory(s), it'll automatically fix the indentation and remove all white spaces from the `.c` and `.h` files.

![fixall demo](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/886ed4c8-7a1b-4e20-8acc-9ba47fadd82f)

| fixall                     | Automatically selects the current directory  |
| fixall dir1 dir2 ...            | Selects the specified directories    |

### Vim Configs

![vim config](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/b438e9c2-2d0b-4e76-9a42-48f0bb11b40f)

The numbers are handy for jumping between lines without counting them.

#### Compiling with F5
To compile the current file by pressing F5, the file must be in this format: "number"-"name".c (e.g., `0-putchar.c`), and there should be a test file usually named "number"-main.c (e.g., `0-main.c`). If the test file doesn't exist, use the `compile` command instead.

![VIM F5 Showcase](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/46ecc108-9288-4f7f-a5b2-b5302f251348)

#### Betty, Pycodestyle, Spellcheck with F2
Press F2 in Vim instead of leaving it to run "betty or pycodestyle or spellcheck file_name.c" separately.

![Betty](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/ccb022bf-b0fa-4089-bfdb-2fa061632744)

#### Auto Indent with F3
Check out this demonstration.
PS : It does not work on python (yet)

![Vim Auto Indent](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/8320f485-856d-4e88-a0dc-c50446d79b9b)

#### Remove Whitespace with F4
Whitespace is highlighted in red.

![TrailierTrash](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/474b5690-1ace-412c-8665-7ed248d5a2a0)

### Readme Maker
To use this script, first configure it by replacing the info as shown:

![readme_config](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/15fec8b3-bee9-4e99-9de6-21afea2d5720)

CD to ALX-Time-Saver and launch the script with `./read_maker.py`. Enter the repo name, project's subdirectory, and make sure everything you need is pushed to GitHub. The script generates markdown for your `README.md`.

![readmaker_demo](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/6414f3c2-4133-42fb-add0-2439154f1071)

Clicking on a file opens it (on GitHub).

### All-in-One Maker
Run the script with `mkfiles`, and the new files will be in your chosen location.

Demonstration:

![mkfiles_rework](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/a0cf69cc-620e-4528-a2da-8f4437d76e28)

### Test Suite
Execute the `setall` command in the sequence of the main function file, followed by the header file and the test cases. Afterward, use the `testall` command, specifying the main function files and the additional function files to initiate the test suite.
Points to Remember:
   - It's unnecessary to employ the `setall` command again when reusing the test suite.
   - To update the test cases, reset the test suite, maintaining the same order of arguments to ensure the corresponding tests are updated.
   - The main function should always be the first argument in the `testall` command; otherwise, it won't function correctly.
   - The additional fucntion files are required during compilation.
   - You can have multiple test suites.

![test suite demo](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/ba21a3d7-77b2-41bf-aa76-206acc67e066)

| Syntax                       | Description                              |
| ------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| setall main_function.c header.h test1.c testX.c ...  | Sets the test suite for the `main_function.c`  |
| testall main_function.c secondary_function.c more_functions.c ...  | Runs the test suite for the `main_function.c` |
