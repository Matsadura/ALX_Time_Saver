# Welcome to "ALX Time Saver"

  Aren't you tired of repeating "git add git commit git push" everytime you want to push a file ? or typing the whole " gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 _putchar.c 0-test_file.c 0-source.c -o 0-output " to test if your modification works ? and let's not talk about finding the trailing white space...

## Features 
### push command 
[Link to My Third-Level Header](#the-"push"-command )
Run the ``push`` command, select which file(s) to push and add your commit message.

![push](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/1788a9aa-ba23-4858-a14c-23a2c374c477)

|push -f|Force add ignored files in interactive mode|
|push file_name1 file_name_2...|One line command|
|push -f file_name1 file_name2...|Force push one line command|

### compile command
Run the ``compile`` command, select the test file if it exists, the code to compile and you're all set, the purpose of this is to avoid typing all the flags everytime.

![compile](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/65957f8a-ea1d-449a-99a3-56b4821691b7)

### mkscript command
Run the ``mkscript``, type the name of your script, it'll automatically open it in vim with ``#!/bin/bash`` or ``#!/usr/bin/python3`` already written on top, do your thing and after exiting the file will already be given the executable permission.

![mkscript](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/ca82fd75-dabc-4590-9e83-0f7d100dc0f5)

### Vim Configs

![vim config](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/b438e9c2-2d0b-4e76-9a42-48f0bb11b40f)

The numbers are useful to jump from line to line without actually counting how many lines are there.
#### Compiling with F5
In order to compile the current file by pressing F5 the following is required :
the file must be in this format "number"-"name".c for exemple ``0-putchar.c``, and the test file which is usually "number"-main.c exemple "0-main.c" .
If the test file doesn't exist use the ``compile`` command instead.

![VIM F5 Showcase](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/46ecc108-9288-4f7f-a5b2-b5302f251348)


#### Betty with F2
Instead of leaving VIM then running " betty file_name.c ", you could press F2 instead in VIM and get betty's results. 

![Betty](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/ccb022bf-b0fa-4089-bfdb-2fa061632744)


#### Auto Indent with F3
For this I'll let this demonstration do the talking.

#### Remove WhiteSpace with F4
White space will be highlighted in Red.

### Readme Maker
To use this script first you must configure it, replace with your info :

![readme_config](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/15fec8b3-bee9-4e99-9de6-21afea2d5720)

cd to the ALX-Time-Saver and launch the script with ``./read_maker.py``, then enter the name of repo, subdirectory of the project, note that you must do this connects to your github so make sure you have everything you need pushed, the output should be in markdown copy it to your ``README.md`` and you're all set.

![readmaker_demo](https://github.com/Matsadura/ALX_Time_Saver/assets/132571698/6414f3c2-4133-42fb-add0-2439154f1071)


If you click on a file it'll open it (in github of course).

### All in one Maker

Run the script with ``mkfiles``, the new files will be in your location of choice.

Demonstration :
